/** 
 * The number of elements in an array is fixed and known.
 * The array allows fast indexed access.
 * 
 * You must provide array size: 
 *      myArray = new String[];  ❌ This won't work
 * 
 * Use enhanced `for` to iterate through an array.
 * Use `length` to get the size of an array. 
 * 
 * Arrays are faster, smaller in memory and used internally in many frameworks.
 * You will see array used in low-level parsing, high-performance code.
